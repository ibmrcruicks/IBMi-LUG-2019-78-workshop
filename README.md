# IUG2019-iAI
Consume Watson AI services on IBMi with Node-RED

A short workshop to demonstrate how you might integrate a Watson Assistant skill with web-, mobile- or messenger-based user self-service IT support functions.

The chatbot application logic runs in the IBM i PASE environment, using native *node.js* and the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) flow-based programming framework.

The chatbot exploits IBM i Services to query system information through the DB2 for i interface, as well as the PASE shell access to run native command-line functions.

Additional AI-based services - translation, tone analysis, speech<-->text conversion will be added to enhance the application.
